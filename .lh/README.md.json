In addition, you have the `Todo` and `User` interfaces already implemented in `./src/types/`.\n\nSplit the given `App` markup into component following the rules:\n\n- don't change CSS class names, they are used in tests;\n- `TodoList` takes the `todos` and renders one `TodoInfo` per `todo` in the array;\n- `TodoInfo` takes a `todo` and renders its details, including a `todo.user` with `UserInfo` component if the todo has a user;\n- make sure that the `TodoInfo` has a `TodoInfo--completed` modifier for all completed todos;\n- `UserInfo` takes a `user` and renders the details.\n\n## Instructions\n- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.\n- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).\n- Use the [React TypeScript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript).\n- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.\n- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://.github.io/react_static-list-of-todos/) and add it to the PR description.\n"
