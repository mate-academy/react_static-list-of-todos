# React Static List of TODOs

> [React + Typescript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript)

You are given `todosFromServer` and `usersFromServer` arrays with the required data.

A `todos` array is based on the `todosFromServer`, but each `todo` has a corresponding user attached. In addition, you have the `Todo` and `User` interfaces already implemented in `./src/types/`.

Split the given `App` markup into component following the rules:

- don't change CSS class names, they are used in tests;
- `TodoList` takes the `todos` and renders one `TodoInfo` per `todo` in the array;
- `TodoInfo` takes a `todo` and renders its details, including a `todo.user` with `UserInfo` component if the todo has a user;
- make sure that the `TodoInfo` has a `TodoInfo--completed` modifier for all completed todos;
- `UserInfo` takes a `user` and renders the details.
