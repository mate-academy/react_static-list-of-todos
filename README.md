# React static list of TODOs
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the
  [DEMO LINK](https://Rocketjet.github.io/react_static-list-of-todos/)
- Follow the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline)

## Task
Import `todos` and `users`, add a user to each todo and render them in the 
list.

1. Create a `preparedTodos` array basing on `todos`. Each prepared todo should
   have a `user` property with a link to a user from `users` array or `null`if
   we can't find a use by `userId`. It should be stored in the `App`.
2. Create a `TodoList` component accepting an array of `preparedTodos` and 
   rendering them as a list
3. Create a `UserInfo` component accepting a `user` object and use it to render
   a `todo.user` in the list with some styling. (Show at least a `name` and an
   `email` of the `user`)
4. Create a `TodoInfo` component accepting a `todo` object and use it in the 
   list to render `title`, `completed` status and `User`

Hint: You can add only the props you use to the `User` interface. `Todo` 
interface should have a `user` property that could be a `User` or `null`.
