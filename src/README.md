# React static list of TODOs

By using [todos.js](todos.js) and [users.js](users.js) as modules to your React application, create and display a list of all the TODO items. Alongside each item display information about the user it belongs to.

Create and use three components: `TodoList` (for the whole list), `TodoItem` (for a single TODO item), and `User` (for displaying information about a user). `TodoList` should display a list of `TodoItem`s; each `TodoItem` must display the basic info about an item as well as the `User` the item belongs to. You can choose yourself what exact information you want to present and how.
